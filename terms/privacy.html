		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>Last Updated: 10 August 2024</p>

		<p><strong>Use of your Google data</strong></p>
		<p>By logging into Milia.app using your Google account, you agree that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Emails you send through our platform should be sent through your Google address rather than through a generic @milia.app address. This allows you to see the history of emails sent from Milia.app in your Gmail application, and also ensures that your customers receive emails in your name rather than from a Milia.app address.</li>
			<li>Milia.app can create a 'Milia.app' calendar in your Google account for us to synchronize the events and appointments that you create on our platform.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These procedures will be carried out via the official Google APIs, and under no circumstances will we use, store, or share your Google data for any other purpose.</p>

		<h2>Part I - Information Collected and Controlled by Milia.app</h2>
		<p>We only collect the information we really need. This includes the information you actively provide to us when you register an account, register for an event, request customer support, or purchase something from us. We store your name and contact information, but we do not store credit card numbers (except with your permission, and on one of our secure payment gateways).</p>
		<p>When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically record certain basic information; for example, how you got to the website, the pages you visited, and the features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services, and to encourage the development of new products.</p>
		<p>We sometimes receive information indirectly. For example, if you sign in to one of our products through the authentication service of a provider such as LinkedIn or Google, they send us your contact information. We then use this information to respond to the request you have made. If you interact with our brand on social media, we will have access to your interactions and profile information.</p>

		<h2>What we do with your information</h2>
		<p>We use your information to provide you with the services you have requested, to create and manage your accounts, and to monitor unauthorized activity on them. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you are currently using, to process your customer support requests, to introduce you to new products that you may like, to provide you with the opportunity to provide feedback, and to inform you of policy updates.</p>
		<p>We analyze the information we collect in order to understand user needs, and to improve our website and services. We may also use your information for our legitimate business interests, such as to monitor and improve our marketing campaigns.</p>

		<h2>Your rights regarding the use of information</h2>
		<p>You can opt out of certain types of use of the information, either by not providing that information in the first place, or by choosing to opt out later on. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from providing information to us. However, please note that in this case, certain features of the website may not function properly.</p>

		<h2>Retention of information</h2>
		<p>We keep your personal data for as long as necessary for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have any legitimate need to process your information, we will ensure that we delete, anonymize, or isolate it, as appropriate.</p>

		<h2>Part II - Information Processed by Milia.app on Your Behalf</h2>
		<p>When you manage the data of others who use Milia.app applications, such as information about your customers or employees, you entrust that data to us for processing. This data is referred to as 'service data'.</p>
		<p>You are the owner of your service data. We protect it, restrict access to it, and only process it in accordance with your instructions. You can access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.</p>
		<p>We keep the data in your account for as long as you choose to use Milia.app Services. Once you terminate your account, your data will be deleted automatically from our active database within 6 months, and from our backups within an additional 3 months.</p>

		<h2>Part III - General Information</h2>
		<p>There are certain limits to the confidentiality that we can promise you. We will disclose personal data if it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce a contract, or protect the safety of our users.</p>
		<p>Third-party sites and social media widgets have their own privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing your personal data with third parties.</p>
		<p>You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices; request a Data Processing Amendment in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); notify us if you believe that we have collected personal data from a minor; or request that your personal data be removed from our blogs or forums.</p>

		<h2>Compliance with this Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>We make every effort, including by way of periodic checks, to ensure that the personal data you provide to us is being used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns about our compliance with this Privacy Policy or the way your personal data is used, please write to us at: <a href="mailto:support@team.milia.app">support@team.milia.app</a>. We will contact you and, where appropriate, coordinate with the appropriate regulatory bodies to address your concerns effectively.</p>

		<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
		<p>We may modify the Privacy Policy at any time, after notifying you through a service announcement or by sending you a message to your primary email address. If we make material changes affecting your rights, you will receive advance notification by email to your primary address at least 30 days in advance.</p>
		<p>If you have any concerns about how we use your personal data, please check back regularly to <a href="privacy.html">https://static.milia.app/terms/privacy.html</a>.</p>
